    <h1 class="articletitle">Books I've enjoyed recently</h1>


<div class="articletext">
    <p>This page is pretty much for my own personal use. I'm trying to keep track of books I've read recently
      (and possibly the topics included in them and a quick review if I have time). I'm hoping that doing this will not only encourage me to read more, but also remind me of what I read
    where incase I want to refernce something in the future.
   </p>

  <h1 class="articletitle">General Interest reads</h1>

  <p>
    The following are all general interest books that I have read and ones I would recommend to others, and the year I've read them. I don't agree with all of them but I also don't regret taking the time to read any of them
    (unless I've explicitly states so - theres a couple I just didn't take to but can understand why others might).
  </p>

       <p>
         By far the best Physics book on Quantum Mechanics for a non physic's graduate. I've read quite a few and, in my opinion, this was by far the best...
          However - it is also more challenging than previous "layman" books I've read.  If you want to acutally get a good handle on what Quantum mechanics
          is then I recommend this book. If you want to read hype and fluff while pretending you're learning physics then go read something my Michael Kaku.

       <p>
         Very enjoyable book detailing how political structure and resources can effect a nations affluence. I would reccomend this over the Dictators handbook as it talks much
         more in depth about the economic affects of political decisions as opposed to simply maintaining political power.
       </p>

       <li><a  href="https://www.ft.com/content/3f5c647a-7768-11e5-a95a-27d368e1ddf7">The Brain: The Story of You</a></li>
       <p>
         A very easy read regading how the human brain developes, functions, and whoes peculiar quirks affect our sense of self. I would have prefered a bit more depth in many areas
         as I feel the book was made to be approachable by someone who had only recently discovered what a brain is... But thins writing style was something that I was quick thankful for
         as you can race through the pages at quite a speed.

         I need to read more from Eric Hobsbawm. I've had "An Age of Extremes" waiting for me to read it for almost a decade now. I should add it to the top of this list...

         This book is less about Markov chains and more about general advice for inversting money into stock options. This was the first devent economics book I read and one which I would
         recommend to everyone and their nan. It's simple advice mostly; often surprising on a first read before seeming obvious in retrospect - which I consider the sign of a good point well
         stated.

       <p>
         Reading in progress. The book that inspired Full Metal Jacket and countless other Vietnam movies. More importanlty its fnatastically written. It has some of the
          non stop urgency to the text that reminds me of Jack Kerouac's "On the road", but is much more poetic and readable ("On the road" nearly killed me.).

         A one evening read of only a hundred pages - this gives a brief account of market booms and busts - including some of the lesser known of the 1960's. Unfortunatley it doesn't
           cover the dot com bubble of the 90s or the CDO bubble of 2007 (the second of which is aptly covered by "The Signal and the Noise") but it does explain WHY this behaviour occurs
           as a general phenomenon - and that it will continue to occur approximately every twenty years.

       <li><a  href="https://www.ft.com/content/3eb31cf6-1049-11e1-8211-00144feabdc0"> The Dictators Handbook</a></li>
       <p>
         Explains how Dictators attain power and policies they should implement to keep power. The book is has a novel view of how to view the actions of countires. not as nation
         states acting as individuals, but as differing systems of government trying only to remain in power. It makes convincing cases for viewing governments in terms of the nominal selectorate,
          the real selectorate and the winning coalition.. However it continues on this so much that the book begins to sound like "Academics found this one wierd trick to understand governments
           - dictators hate them!". I would say it picks up towards the midle though as it says how Dictators react to natural disasters and foreign aid.

         I will write a better review of this book when I have a chance.. but in short there was something in the writing that made me hate the main character and narrator. I don't know
         if its because I saw them as an unreliable narrator, a narrascist or simply their claim to be intellectually superiour to everyone around them but I couldn't stand it. I made it half way through
         before giving up...

       <p>
         Written by some prominent convervative party back benchers so I wanted to see what ideas the tories had in mind for the future o the country. Overall the book makes good point regarding
         government deficits and liberal economies. On the other hand the authors totally misunderstand Singapore in every reference to it and why it is economically sucessful (its not libertarianism).

         Had been meaning to read this for a while. A diary of shorts of Orwells time with the working class of north England.

       <li><a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_Days">Burmese Days</a></li>
       <p>
         This is an account of Orwells time in Burma (now Myanmar, then part of British India) posing as a Novel. The story is interesting enough book acts mainly as a pretense
         for his anti-colonial opinions and wonderful natural descriptions. I read this while travelling Burma by train and, outside of ariconditioning in the hotels, it seems that little has changed
         since George penned his words.

       <li><a  href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/10/contest-century-new-era-competition-china-review">The Contest of the Century</a></li>
       <p>
         Undoubtably the best book about Chinas economic and foreign policy ambitions, and the forces driving both, that I have seens, BY FAR. I dont use a FT link here as the athour, Geoff Dyer, writes for the times.
         They have another review posted on FT by Irvine and author of 'China in the 21st Century: What Everyone Needs to Know'. This touches so many things and, in I believe, should be read
         by every political student and politician in office in the west.

       <li><a  href="https://www.amazon.com/Caliphate-Hugh-Kennedy/dp/0141981407">The Caliphate</a></li>
       <p>
         A very dry history of Islam, generally, and the Caliphates (explaining what Caliphates wer at different times). Would be best used as a reference book as I can't for the like of me remember
       most of the dates, only the general evolution of things. Interesting non-the-less.
