    <p> Who is this book by? You only agree with these if you agree with the idea that google is extrodinary company. How are the sales. Is is available by swedish buckaneers. I've been watching alot of silicon valley recently so maybe I'm just slightly jaded.</p>


    <h2>Laying out office space</h2>

    <h2>Growth and recruiting at every level</h2>

    <p>Something that has been hammered home recently, except for the importance of flossing as taught to me by my dentist, is that the most important aspect of a small business of an idea is growth. Making interviewing a privalidge. Focus on the individuals over the team. Even down to paying different people. Keeping the work challenging. Also making sure not to hire bad people - this is concerning compared to growing quicly. </p>

    <p>This also talked specifically about the idea that people simply are not equal. Not that everyone has a role somewhere - but specificially that some people must be removed from proximity to a business quickly. </p>

    <h2>Importance of interviewing</h2>


    <p>Heres an example of what it is! </p>

    <p> Are all of these good advice for a businsess growth.</p>

    <p>Check out the google brainteasers</p>

    <p>Why statistics is going to be important. The idea is that as things become cheap and quickly generated, we must be competant. It was true of the microchip. So maybe neural networks and genetic algorithms are a good idea for the future!</p>
