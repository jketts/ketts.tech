  Boson sampling

  Here is the article by Aarson and .. that made this area famous. Boson sampling has been experimentally run ..

  However, <em>I believe</em> that all of these experiments fail to satisfy the conditions derived by rahimi keshari et al in model for boson sampling that accounts for
  experimental parameters, which when they are not satisfied the problem demonstration the results may be sampled by a classical process. This model accounts for detector efficiency (including darkcounts),
   source efficiency and waveguid efficiency.

  The complaint about Boson samplong is that a state which has a positive P function its sample problem is neccasarily easy to simulate - as it may be viewed as a mixture of coherent states.

   Some also contend that boson sampling is useless - its not even a unifrom random number generator. random numbers are weighted by the perminence.
  this is not to do with additive error on amplitured - is see if the errors cause this to just become mix of coherent.

  this is  SO losses and effieciencies.

          This method is none deterministic. but can we deal with this.

          use gate telepotation.
          concatinated gate teleportation, concatinated gate failure tolerant code. by going state preperation stage.

          But unfortunately bell gates are also noisy.

          but this is less noisy that before. so just concatinate this.




          ...


          other method is cluster states. edges are cz gates.

          use multiplexing via linear optics to approximante number resoltion using a non-number resolving detectors.

          Alternately you can convert to time bin encodings. make number of time slots large compared to numer of photons.

          use SPDC and post selct. but this is none deterministic.

          boson sampling

          non universal model of LOQC

          no entangling
          no qubits
          comletely passive
          all fock state inputs



          just sample the output. at output we get superpositions of all possible outputs. This belongs to #P (which is probably more complex than NP).

          implies sampling is hard. can't be used to calculate matrix perminence. Sampling would need an exponential amount to find this.

          U is Haar random. this is sampling problem, not a decision problem.


          can sampling probelms be relating to probabilistic computing?


          Arrson said this is hard.
