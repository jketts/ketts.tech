    <h1 class="articletitle"> Worries about the future of Quantum Information </h1>

    <div class="openingimage">

<div class="articletext">
    <p>Before I start this article I must preface it with the following points to address where these opinions are coming from. I am a final year PhD student in a reasonably respected group who has developed an
      overt distain for acedemia and decided to leave immediatley upon graduation.
   My group is respected; My adisor has published in sceince and nature - his position in the the field is assured. My own research is, honestly, less than ground breaking however I have a few papers to my name and enough to claim
   a advancement to the field worthy of graduation.
  My reasoning for wanting to leave the field stems from 1) the apparent unhappiness I witness daily in the lives of the postdocs (both junior and senior) and the turmoil that chasing postitions and funding
  has cuased in thier personal lives, 2) the difficulty of the people in the area to talk to (physicist are, by and large, difficult people - and i will be first to admit I am one of them), and
  3) the ridiculuousness of the funding game, university beaurocracy and intergroup/conference politics required on a day to day basis.   </p>

<p>
Now, although I am leaving acedemia for all of the above, they are not the reasons why I am leaving the field of Quantum Information. I am leaving because I am seriously concerned about its prospects - that many are
dramatically overstated, and, like the first round of machine learning in the 80's - its a big bubble which is soon to go pop. I will describe the reasons this is happening below. I just want to be clear that while I am
bitter and the PhD esperience has left a sour taste in my mouth, and they have, the problems with QI are a different kettle of fish.
</p>

    <h2>So what is QI</h2>

<p>
  Note: if you already know what quantum inforamtion, quantum computing and quantum cryptography are, then you can skip this part!
what it is

why people care

speed up (and cracking codes)
</p>

<h2>Bubbles</h2>
<p>
  When machine learning was first coming into fashion the field was going to be huge - however.. examples being when a PhD student was ssigned with building a system for speech recognition..
eventually with a lack of meaningful progress the funding dried up, and the AI inter approached. Many of the groups stopped - professors moved into different areas, and the field went to
the examine its own the foundations on what was really viable. It wasnt until much later with the advance of the GPU and neural networks the the field became a buzz word again (but this time - with must more
justifcation.).

Unknown to most of the outside world - this boom and bust cycle is happening constantly in acedemia. Yesterdays stone carved truths only become tomorrows sediment. There have been two recent examples for this in QI. And the rise and fall of these bubbles
seems to be gathering pace. Yes these topics may one day become useful - but thats to zeal of researchers and overhype they hve done little to advance pool of human knowledge and mostly wastes a lot of taxpayer money and
wasted a lot of man hours.

Lets forst talk about boson sampling.

This is a relatively simple set up. You have some bosons (photons), and some passive linear optics (beam splitters, phase shifters). You send the photons through the linear optics and measure where
you detect them at the other side. As the bem splitters may be inherenetly probabilitic (you don't know which side of a beam splitter a single photon will come out of) you end up getting a sample of some distribution
of outputs. Maybe you think this is interesting..? Personally I don't.

Well - this area really took off after Arronson wrote a paper describing how this is part of a sampling problem which is classically dificult to simulate. Great! said experimental groups - we can
do a quantum experiment that is actually better than something classical right now!

We firstly lets look at arronsons claim:


This then resulted in a lot of boson sampling papers. Some even claim that this somehow proved the extended church turing thesis.

Oh and if anyone knows a use for this sampling problem then please speak up. Despite all this work and controversy noone has even found a use for this problem - making the whole business seem a bit
useless.


A second example is discord.
discord, Schordingers rat

Hi rats,

These days I’ve been searching in the garbage bin (i.e., arxiv) for a nice topic to chew. I didn’t have to dig deep. A preliminary search shows that only this year there have been uploaded 129 articles on quantum discord, and the number is growing as I write this post. This puts discord into the category of pandemic. The stakes are high: if we don’t act soon, quantum discord could destroy thousands of promising scientific careers, and possibly even cause the end of civilization!
But let’s go by parts.

The quantum discord of a bipartite state was first defined by Ollivier and Zurek as the difference between its original quantum mutual information and the same quantity after we perform a rank-1 projective measurement on one part.

Now, what does that mean? Probably, nothing. But lack of motivation has never prevented investigation at international scale. And so we ended up with one more research topic that clearly goes nowhere, in the line of entanglement sudden death, NMR quantum computing and quantum game theory (ah! You don’t remember quantum game theory? Then suffer!!).

The first victims of the epidemic were the hundreds of PhD students who were forced to calculate quantum discord in the weirdest physical scenarios: ground states of inexistent spin chains, non-inertial frames, cavity QED, nuclear spins… This extraordinary proliferation of unnecessary calculations may remind some of the negativity fever we experienced in QI just seven years ago. There, the goal was to compute the negativity of every bipartite two-level system in the Universe, and their proponents nearly succeeded at this task.

[A reflexion: if you are not sure about the meaning of a quantity, is it worth calculating it?]

Nevertheless, there is a big difference between entanglement and quantum discord.
An experimental demonstration of entanglement can be quite challenging, both for the experimentalist and the theorist. Experimentally, you need a degree of control of your physical system in order to prepare the state and perform the appropriate tomographic measurements. Theoretically, you have to prove that a particular density matrix (or a family of density matrices with certain features) is out of the set of separable states, whose approximate characterization is a strongly NP-hard problem.

In contrast, as shown by Ferraro et al., the set of states with zero quantum discord has zero measure. This is very convenient from an experimental point of view, because it makes quantum tomography obsolete: any experimentalist that prepares a bipartite quantum system can immediately claim that it has non-zero quantum discord on the grounds that he was able to produce it!!

Now, you may think that the 2009 article by Ferraro et al. put a stop to discord research. That was actually the original intention of the authors (I happen to know them). However, rather than killing the bacteria, the vaccine made them stronger. Check for yourselves! The number of yearly papers on the subject has doubled since 2009. More interestingly, Ferraro et al.’s paper has now 195 citations, all from articles on quantum discord.

How can that be? I recently witnessed a talk about discord where this paper was cited. Naturally, I was curious about why someone would like to mention a paper that discredits all his research. This is the explanation I got:

“Ferraro et al.’s result shows us that discord is everywhere. Consequently, discord is at the heart of every quantum communication protocol”.

Now THAT is an argument! Let me rephrase it in a more casual way:

“Dude!! This is amazing!! There is discord between your mouth and my penis!!!”.

Unfortunately, the fact that everything has discord erases the meaning of the quality “non-zero discord”. Imagine a world where everybody is blonde. Would the word “blonde” have a meaning? Wouldn’t it be like “wireless”?

One of the latest mutations of The Plague has the form of papers “proving” that certain separable states with non-zero discord constitute a resource in bipartite communication protocols. The truth is: that can only be true in very artificial scenarios. First, if your figure of merit depends linearly on the initial state, or is just convex, any result you may achieve with a separable state (with zero or non-zero discord) can be equalled or improved with a pure product state (of zero discord). Second, even if your figure of merit is not convex, any communication protocol with steps 1, 2, …, n that requires a separable state rho with non-zero discord at step 1 can be implemented too if, at the beginning of the protocol, both parties share a correlated classical state (of zero discord) and use the classical correlations of their zero-discord state to prepare rho locally before proceeding to step 1.

Rats, I don’t know what to do. Men greater than this rodent have tried to stop this madness, but have failed miserably. Were they too subtle in expressing their dislike for discord? Shall we throw our excrements at the speaker’s face next time we attend a talk on the topic in order to make our point clear? I can’t say that I approve this. But, should you do it, send me the video.

Ok, I’m tired. These are the take-home messages:

1) Kids: say "no" to quantum discord! It's just not worth it!

2) Discord Stus of the world: if my arguments haven't convinced you to stop spreading your disease, then at least stop calling it "quantum correlations". The term "quantum correlations" has been disputed for many years by the entanglement and nonlocality communities. The last thing we need is a new third party messing things even more.

The list goes on. Device independence?
Just make any old crap scheme device independent and whoever writes the next paper will have to cite it. Th circle continues.


how to make a field - and how grants premote this behaviour

The big journals (Nature at the forefront) prefer to publish tons of poor science rather than risking and losing a single real breakthrough. So, if someone claims to have solved “the mystery of the quantum” (the general readership of Nature finds quantum physics mysterious), better take them seriously.
In turn, people notice that “if you do that, you publish in Nature”. Since “that” is not that difficult after all, it’s worth while going for it.
Once you have published in Nature (or Science or…), you are hailed as a hero by the head of your Department, by the communication office of your university, by the agencies that granted you the funds.
Put yourself now at the other end, namely in the place of the one who would like to raise a dissenting voice and reveal the triviality of the result. All the legitimate instances (peer reviewed journals, heads of prestigious Departments, grant agencies, even popular magazines and newspapers!) are against you. Isn’t it “obvious” then that you are only venting your jealousy, the jealousy of the loser?
So far, the analogy with financial euphoria is clear. I guess (though I have not studied the statistics) that the speed of the crash is also analogously fast: it happens when some of the editors of the main journals take a conscious decision of having “no more of that”, because they realize that there is really nothing to gain. The rumor spreads that “refereeing has become tough”; the journals are accused of having become irrational since “if they accepted the previous paper, why they refuse this one” (while it’s one of their few moments of rationality).



unnnessacary experiments

will it back fire? it is ofter said that work such as this will backfire. That somehow after worming the way into nature or science with this tripe the futility of the article will one day be realsied
and the authors will be embarrassed and ridiculed. This will never happen. In the end, at worst, the field is forgotten and everyone moves on. No one will notice or care.

Those who face uncertain destiny are the young fellows, who were doing serious science when the euphoria caught them at the right time and the right place. Because of this, they have been raised to prominence. Somehow, all their capital is invested in that topic. Will they be able to find their way out and continue doing serious science? Or will they end up teaming with their buddies, set up a specialized journal for themselves and publishing there until their old age?

<h2>The next bubble</h2>
<p>
Now - if you are paticularly inclined you may think to yourself "this all seems well and good- as long as you get the the field first! You get a few rockstar papers and
your career is made!" well in that case I can tell you know what the next buzz will be - Quantum Machine learning. Half of my group is moving into it and my professor is currently trying
to pivot there himself. Imagine , the speed up of quantum mechanics and the power of machine learning! Yee gods its got more buzz about it than a beehive.

The idea is as follows:
Find some specific algorithms which can be preformed faster with a quamtum computer.
Find a machine learning method with uses a classcial version of this algorithm
Replace this part with a quantum version.
Marvel at how you have now created another example of quantum supremecy.

Unfortunely, depite this area taking off so rapidly it overlooks some problems - such as in many cases this speedups just don't exist.

Then first example is one for matrix inversion. This is used in several methods including.... It was noted by Seth Lloyd here that if the matrix is sparse then this can be completed faster
with a quantum algorithm. Thus opening the door for a slew of papers.


However.. theres also a method for matrix inversion of sparse matrices which completes in the same time.

And this doesn't even mention the real bottle neck - moving from classical the quantum data. If we want to apply this then we must reform our classical input as a quanutm state - however. this turns out to
be a very difficult problem which takes .. time. Killing off any quantum advantage.


</p>

<h2>Experimental implementations</h2>
<p>
  As you may note - we are slowly working into specfics. It has been widely stated that many of the problems now are simply with experimental implementation - not with theory. And that this
  is all improving with advances such as the IBM 16 qubit machine or (more comtroversially) Dwaves machine. (note that Dwave proforms quantum annealing - which has o indication of being any better than
  classical annealing.).

  And while these are worthwhile endevours...

  One problem here is the widely repeated statement that:

  The hopes for scalable quantum computing are founded entirely on the
“threshold theorem”: once the error per qubit per gate is below a certain value,
indefinitely long computations are possible.


The mathematical proof of the threshold theorem heavily relies on a
number of assumptions supposed to be fulfilled exactly, as axioms.

In the physical world nothing can be exact when one deals with continuous
quantities. For example, it is not possible to have zero interaction between qubits,
it can only be small.
4. Since the basic assumptions cannot be fulfilled exactly, the question is:
What is the required precision with which each assumption should be fulfilled?
5. Until this crucial question is answered, the prospects of scalable quantum
computing will remain uncertain.




Worryingly - experimental problems do not only arise when talking about quantum computing. But also with crypto.

This has led serveral to guess "that the
field, similar to non-quantum modern cryptography, is going to split in two directions: those who
pursue practical devices may have to moderate their security claims; those who pursue ultimate
security may have to suspend their claims of usefulness. "

<h2>Strong on the basics</h2>
<p>
  problems with shor

  The first experiment reporting factoring 15 by Shor was done
by Vandersypen et al14 using the liquid nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
technique. All the gates were implemented by microwave pulses applied within
about 1s, which is less than the nuclear decoherence time. The obtained NMR
spectra corresponded very well to the predictions of Shor’s procedure.
Lanyon et al15 performed the same task in an optical experiment using the
polarization of 4 photons, while Lucero et al16 used Josephson qubits: “...we run a
three-qubit compiled version of Shor's algorithm to factor the number 15, and
successfully find the prime factors 48% of the time”.
An aside about the “compiled version” of Shor’s algorithm is in order. The
full algorithm can factor a k-bit number using 72k
3
elementary quantum gates;
e.g., factoring 15 requires 4608 gates operating on 21 qubits.17 Ref. 17
introduced a compiling technique which exploits properties of the number to be
factored, allowing exploration of Shor’s algorithm with a vastly reduced number
of resources. One might say that this is a sort of (innocent) cheating: knowing in
advance that 15=3×5, we can take some shortcuts, which would not be possible if
the result were not known beforehand.
All the existing experimental testing of Shor’s algorithm use this simplified
approach. Recently, in a very remarkable work of Martin−Lόpez et al,18 this
approach allowed for the first time to factor 21 in an optical experiment, where an
iterative procedure of recycling a single qubit was successfully implemented.
The demonstration of the full Shor’s algorithm for factoring 15 is still well
beyond the reach of experimental possibilities (see the prediction in Ref. 19
