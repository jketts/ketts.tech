    <p> Who is this book by? You only agree with these if you agree with the idea that google is extrodinary company. How are the sales. Is is available by swedish buckaneers. I've been watching alot of silicon valley recently so maybe I'm just slightly jaded.</p>


    <h2>What</h2>

    <p>So I've been home brewing for a while now. Me and my housemate blake have been homebrewing beer. It was actually one of the first things I looked into after moving to Singapore - I was aware there was a scene for it here after seeing his article: .. <br>
      But this article isn't really about beer... its more about making a fridge. Theres lots of information online about how to make beer so I won't explain what people have already done here.
     </p>

    <h2>Step 1: Get a fridge</h2>

    <p>This was the easy pretty part - I just rented a van via GOGOvan and looked on carosel. The fidge was pretty new and is a SANSUNG. Fidge was SGD$100 and the van was approx SGD$70 (this was a little expensive as I'd actually been hauling some furniture for my new balcony layout from the other side of the island). </p>

    <h2>Step 2: Back off</h2>

    <p>Take the back off the fridge</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Unsing the Photon</h2>

    <p>Take the back off the fridge</p>
