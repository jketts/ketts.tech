    <h1 class="articletitle"> How I built this site </h1>



<div class="articletext">
    <p> So if you're reading this then it means that this website is finally online! </p>

    <div class="openingimage">
      <img src="sitemaker/sitemake.png" alt ="[example of the code for making the front page]" width="50%" height="50%">
    </div>

    <p>
    I've been meaning to build a website for YEARS... it just seems to be one of those things that everyone wants to do but never gets round to.
    I first started one when I first went to university but never got past index.html mostly due to my work with <a href="bummit.html">BUMMIT</a> taking up most of my free time.
     Then after finishing my Masters and having a little time before I moved to Singapore I started doing a little more programming in my free time again.
      I wrote a bullet-storm game in Java using this guide <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98eOOCk2fOFg7Qg5yoQfFAdf">by thechernoproject</a>,
      and also an almost complete personal site.
      However - it was more of the standard academic page with contacts, publications, interest and nothing else.
      As I was nearly complete, I realised what I made wasnt really what I wanted, which was somewhere I could show off projects I had been working on and store useful code that I had written.
      So I decided to scrap most of the CSS and HTML that I had down to do a rewrite. But once again, life got in the way and I moved to singapore before I could finish...

      <br><br>
      Now, coming towards the end of my PhD, this page should finally be online- and about time too.
    </p>

    <h3>"Why don't I just use wordpress"</h3>

    <p>My friend actually asked me this after I showed him the first draft of this site (which was rather garish as I had been debugging some of the pading areas by using different garish background colours in each  div).
      And honestly - I hadn't even considered it as an option. I'd always just thought that if I was going to have a site then I was going to make the site.
      After quite a while of building I'm not sure if my opinion has changed - its taken a little time to make as I had not written CSS, HTML or Javascript in a while.
      And honestly... I'm not sure if it looks as nice as a premade template which I could have filled out in an afternoon and saved myself a lot of effort.
       But, I've certainly learnt a lot more code and I do get proudly say that I built the site myself - and thats probably better in the long term.</p>

    <h3>Code and setup</h3>

    <p>So the code for the site is available <a href="https://github.com/jketts/ketts.tech">here</a>. I am frequently updating the git to and pulling onto the hosting server instead of uploading directly.
      I'm aware this probably isn't an elegant solution - but it does have the advantage of allowing me to go to an earlier edition incase I make some disastrous changes that
       break everything (probably the javascript).

 <br><br>

       To allow the articles to sort via catagory and display nicely on the page I used the isotope plugin which is available <a href="http://isotope.metafizzy.co/">here</a>.
       Its very easy to get working using the documantation on the site. The jist of it is that you may easily create a new element which will be auto-positioned for in a grid which
       you define on the page. You can then tag each element to allow it to be sorted into a catagory.
       These elements dont have to all be the same size  - and the javascript will mosaic them quite neatly if they are different sizes -
       but I found it made my page look a little cleaner when every article link was the same size.

       <br><br>
       The domain name was purchased through <a href="https://www.namecheap.com">namecheap</a> and the server is from <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets">digital ocean</a>,
       both were super simple to set up and had lots of prompts on the site to make sure I knew what I was doing <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-16-04">such as this one which I used.</a> <br>
       I would like so say a huge thankyou too data David from <a href="https://dsa.tech/">dsa.tech</a> for the recommendation on the hosting and ample
        help with the apache commands to get everything up and running.

  <br><br>
  So lets look briefly at the commands to set up the site. Bare in mind that, as I've named this site ketts.tech
  - thats the name you should replace if you are using these instructions to put up your own site.


  Assuming you've already purchase the domain name, and the have the server that will host the site, and you've connected them, then first SSH into the server.
  This should be as easy as <strong> ssh root@ketts.tech </strong>. second; update the password on the site from the default. You're now running as root and you'll need to add a new user:
   <strong> adduser NEWUSERNAME </strong> then give that user sudo privilages using <strong> usermod -aG sudo ketts </strong>. There, done.

    <br><br>

    Now, in a seperate terminal window, you may ssh into the server as this new user and follow the instructions below:

<ul>
  <li><strong> ssh NEWUSERNAME@ketts.tech </strong>, too SSH into the server  </li>
 <li> <strong> sudo ufw app list</strong> To start allowing general traffic to contact the site </li>
<li>  <strong> sudo ufw allow OpenSSH </strong> </li>
  <li> <strong> sudo ufw enable </strong> </li>
  <li> <strong> sudo ufw status</strong> check everything is OK</li>
  <li> <strong> sudo ufw allow http </strong>  </li>
  <li><strong>  sudo ufw allow https </strong> </li>
  <li><strong>  sudo ufw status </strong>  again, check everything is OK</li>
  <li><strong>  cd /var sudo apt-get install  apache2 </strong> install apache</li>
  <li><strong>  cd www/ sudo git clone https://github.com/jketts/ketts.tech.git  </strong> clone the website from github </li>
  <li><strong>  cd ketts.tech/ sudo git pull </strong>  </li>
    <li><strong>  cd /etc/apache2 </strong>  Now go to apache </li>
    <li> <strong> sudo nano 000-default.conf </strong> and edit the config - to include the git name </li>
    <li> <strong> sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www </strong>  </li>
    <li><strong>  sudo a2ensite 000-default.conf </strong> </li>
<li><strong> sudo service apache2 reload </strong> quickly restart apache, the website should now be live! </li>
<li>Now, if you're like me you may be contantly wanting to fiddle with bits of the site.
  To do this, just ssh back in, navigate to the corect dirrectoty using <strong> cd var/www/ketts.tech </strong> then use <strong> sudo git pull </strong> to update
. </li>
<li> Sometimes it doesn't want to update - as it thinks an edit has been made to the files! To ignore this (as we only ever want to pull from the git to the server)
  <strong> sudo git stash </strong> and then <strong> sudo git pull </strong> again. </li>

</ul>
