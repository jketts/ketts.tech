    <p> So if you're reading this then it means that this website is finally online! </p>
    <p>
    I've been meaning to build a website for YEARS... it just seems to be one of those things that everyone wants to do but never gets round to.
    I first started one when I first went to university but never got past index.html mostly due to my work with <a href="bummit.html">BUMMIT</a> taking up most of my free time.
     Then after finishing my Masters and having a little time before I moved to Singapore I started doing a little more programming in my free time again.
      I wrote a bullet-storm game in Java using this guide <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98eOOCk2fOFg7Qg5yoQfFAdf">by thechernoproject</a>,
      and also an almost complete personal site.
      However - it was more of the standard academic page with contacts, publications, interest and nothing else.
      As I was nearly complete, I realised what I made wasnt really what I wanted, which was somewhere I could show off projects I had been working on and store useful code that I had written.
      So I decided to scrap most of the CSS and HTML that I had down to do a rewrite. But once again, life got in the way and I moved to singapore before I could finish...

      <br><br>
      Now, coming towards the end of my PhD, this page should finally be online- and about time too.
    </p>

    <h3>"Why don't I just use wordpress"</h3>

    <p>My friend actually asked me this after I showed him the first draft of this site (which was rather garish as I had been debugging some of the pading areas by using different garish background colours in each  div).
      And honestly - I hadn't even considered it as an option. I'd always just thought that if I was going to have a site then I was going to make the site.
      After quite a while of building I'm not sure if my opinion has changed - its taken a little time to make as I had not written CSS, HTML or Javascript in a while.
      And honestly... I'm not sure if it looks as nice as a premade template which I could have filled out in an afternoon and saved myself a lot of effort.
       But, I've certainly learnt a lot more code and I do get proudly say that I built the site myself - and thats probably better in the long term.</p>

    <h3>Code</h3>

    <p>So the code for the site is available  <a href="http://isotope.metafizzy.co/">here</a>.
       To allow the articles to sort via catagory and display nicely on the page I used the isotope plugin which is available <a href="http://isotope.metafizzy.co/">here</a>.
       Its very easy to get working using the documantation on the site. The jist of it is that you may easily create a new element which will be auto-positioned for in a grid which
       you define on the page. You can then tag each element to allow it to be sorted into a catagory.
       These elements dont have to all be the same size  - and the javascript will mosaic them quite neatly if they are different sizes -
       but I found it made my page look a little cleaner when every article link was the same size. </p>
