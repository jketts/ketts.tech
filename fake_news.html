    <h1 class="articletitle">Fake News Hackathon</h1>


<div class="articletext">

  <p>
    This is a write up of a project we completed at a hackathon on the 14th October 2017 at the Google office in Singapore. Although we didn't win, we were one of the finalists.
    <a href="https://github.com/jketts/tbv">The github of our code is here.</a> The other team members were the imfamous <a href="https://dsa.tech/">DSA</a>,
     my coworker <a href="http://tommasodemarie.com/">Tommaso Demaire</a>, fellow SUTD student Andrei Bytes, and SUTD postdoc Balamurali.
  </p>


  <div class="openingimage">
    <img src="fakenews/poster.png" alt ="tulipmania" width="85%" height="85%">
  </div>

  <p>
The aim of the hackathon was to use crowdsourcing to stop fake news. Now, it was explained that there is a major government fear that, because older Singaporean are
very non tech savvy, misinformation can spread incredibly quickly. They seem especially worried about false reports of terrorist incidents (a terrorist style attack
seems to be something that Singapore is incredibly worried about - the who country is full of posters says “not if - but when!”. As someone from the UK,
 which has been getting bombed since bombs were invented, I find this is weird). However, our team didn't really like the fixation on crowdsourcing.
 We believe the only real solution to finding truth is good journalism - and using crowd sourcing (and comformity) to find an objective truth should not be the
  direction we want to encourage. But that was the topic...
  </p>

  <p>
 Our solution was to inoculate vulnerable people against fake news. The thinking is as follows:
</p>

 <p>
 People like fake news. This is shown in how much more often it is shared on social media than other types on news. People also live in online filter bubbles.
 They like living in filter bubbles where their opinions are reinforced. People will not proactively try to break out of filter bubbles.
 They will not install an app to have their opinions challenged.
 </p>


       <div class="openingimage">
         <img src="fakenews/im1.png" alt ="tulipmania" width="85%" height="85%">
       </div>

<p>
This means that any approach that requires the public to be proactive is probably going to fail.
</p>

<p>
However, there a method is known to combat this, which is referred to, at least in US intelligence, as disinfo inoculation.
This is similar to a vaccine; exposing people to untrustworthy news sources, and labeling them as such, before they see the news.
 Everything they consume from that point on is immediately taken with a pinch of salt, so to speak.
</p>

<div class="openingimage">
  <img src="fakenews/im2.png" alt ="tulipmania" width="85%" height="85%">
</div>


<p>
More news sites, even fake new sites, like to become established. Making new websites and getting the information network to follow your new site takes a while to build up.
This means that fake news articles are actually quite easy to find.
</p>

<p>
The so if the solution was just about identifying fake news that would be no good as this is already well studied. Again, the easiest solution is essentially good journalism.
</p>

<div class="openingimage">
  <img src="fakenews/im5.png" alt ="tulipmania" width="85%" height="85%">
</div>

<p>
What we did first was find relatively insular groups who might be susceptible to fake news. To do this we found networks, which we call cliques,
of high highly connected individuals (We call them cliques because they are highly interconnected - I know this isn't the true mathematical definition of a clique!)
around highly biased political sources. For example, one way to find them was by analyzing the followers of Breitbart news. We aren't saying the Breitbart is fake news -
but the community that follows Breitbart, and is quite insular, and leans to the rightwing of politics, will be susceptible to fake news confirming their beliefs
 (for example; new stories about the Pope endorsing Trump).
</p>

<p>
This network was easily identified and graphed using twitter, which is easily scraped using the python TWEEPY, and TWECOLLS packages.
I mostly used TWECOLLS, which allows us to instantly form a graph of follower connections. We can then identify the most influential people in a network,
 and the path on which information is likely to travel in the network. This scraping takes a little time - as the TWITTER API will throttle you if you make too many requests.
</p>

<div class="openingimage">
  <img src="fakenews/im4.png" alt ="tulipmania" width="85%" height="85%">
</div>

<p>
We then identified other networks around what are generally considered moderate and established news sources, or sources which are more politically neutral.
We define these networks to more trust worthy if includes many members with differing political tastes (some are also followers of leftwing sources, some are
 also followers of rightwing sources).  We used the straits times to find our network in the hackathon (because they were a sponsor and we were totally pandering).
</p>




<p>
OK - now this is set up we can start fighting the fake news.
</p>

<p>
When we see a post trending in one network, which is likely to be fake (for example if its one of the
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fake_news_websites">known fake sites</a> ) , we preform a search in the trusted network,
 again using the twitter API, for related stories. These may criticize the source, or directly address the issue. We then link that information to people on
 the edge of the biased first network - essentially front running the information so they are more skeptical should they receive fake news in the future.
</p>


<div class="openingimage">
  <img src="fakenews/im6.png" alt ="tulipmania" width="85%" height="85%">
</div>



<p>
Problem solved! If we can inoculate the correct node, then we are able to dramatically limit the spread of fake articles in the graph.
Yes - it may seem weird to randomly receive an article about an issue you've not heard of, or criticizing a source, but this is because you are likely to hear about it soon.
</p>

<div class="openingimage">
  <img src="fakenews/im7.png" alt ="tulipmania" width="85%" height="85%">
</div>


<h3> But we could also use think to stop polarizing effects in society of filter bubbles.</h3>

<p>
Now, this method could also be used to link to groups with conflicting opinions. If instead of just looking at fake news, you just identify tending news,
 and instead of biased and moderate networks, we choose them both to be biased on different sides on any issue. Using this you could inoculate about opinions,
  or - if the system is run both ways sending information between the two networks, create a genuine balanced dialogue between the two groups. Or they might just fight.
   Either way - we considered this better than living in a filter bubble.
</p>

<p>
So - we got all this working in 4 hours!
</p>

<p>
It scrapes twitter, forms the graphs, checks for fake news trending in one of them, searches the other for relevant links on the story or source,
 and cross posts back to smaller nodes in the first graph.
</p>

<p>
I also used gephi to display the graph data. This is a little bit buggy but something I would certainly love to be using more in the future.

<h2>AND THAT'S NOT ALL!</h2>

<p>
We also fleshed out an app, for no other reason than because our team is awesome. If the search on the trusted network receives no results,
 then there is no way for us to inoculate people against a story. The app simply spots if a new story/source in trending in the group
 and should inform journalists to make a new post. Admittedly - we could of also got a twitter bot to do this... but one of our members really want to make an app,
 so who are we to say no.
</p>

<div class="openingimage">
  <img src="fakenews/app2.png" alt ="tulipmania" width="85%" height="85%">
</div>


<h2>Further applications of the work</h2>

<p>
So the great thing about this approach is that it is completely autonomous. We just need to think how to deploy it.
</p>

<p>
Although this solution was implemented for twitter, we could really use this approach anywhere.
The reason we chose twitter is that the API makes it easy to search, so it is ideal for a hackathon,
 but in theory this could be done over any network provided you have two things;
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ability to see what people are talking about </li>
  <li>Ability to see who is connected, or likely to be connected, to who </li>
</ol>

</p>

<p>
For certain social networks, this is hard as content is private (for example on WhatsApp or telegram), however forming networks is possible
(for example via using phone contacts, linkedIn contacts or facebook friends). Our thinking was that information and opinions aren't limited to a single platform
- if people want to discuss something they will spread it over different platforms so by inoculating people one network you can still affect the others.
 A broad approach may work well to connect people across different applications if possible. This approach is general enough to use on any network -
 we could also use it to connect online blogs or news sites so they don't accidentally spread fake news from each other
 (presuming that the journalists are not taking the time to investigate stories thoroughly before publishing a "breaking news" story).
</p>


<h2>Results</h2>


<p>
Now... we didn't win; but we thought we did have a good approach. Surely the best app to defend against fake news is the one you never have to use at all?
</p>

<p>
Some of the other finalists ideas included allowing Google info (where you hold down the home button on android so it gives information about what is on your screen)
 to also do reverse image search. This is a great idea which should implement regardless of how well it may combat fake news. Another idea was one wherein fake new
 is sites area spread purposefully, but sharing the news via social media will send you to the snopes page explaining why its fake
 (thus embarrassing you for sharing a fake story!) - personally I wasn't convinced this was a great idea.. if people don't read the article then
  all this amounts to is actually spreading more fake news. Another team just made a database of some popular Singapore websites, and did sentiment analysis.
   They then made a chrome plugin than would show the results of the sentiment analysis when it detects a link to one of these pages. This was the winner.
</p>

<p>
These are all good ideas - but I'm really convinced that anything that requires users to stop and think isn't going to work.
 We did get some free Google cardboard for getting to the final so that was cool I guess.
</p>
