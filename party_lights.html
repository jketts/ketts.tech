    This page is still under constructon!
  </p>


    <p>
      Every year for Halloween we have a party. So far they have all been fantastic - so I wanted to make a little effort to document how they were set up.
    </p>

    <p>
       After the success of last years halloween party we once again constructed party lights for the event this year.
    </p>

    <p>This was once again similar to last years set up - we have a audunio acting as slave to the pi which is running the LED strips.
      Unfortunately there don't seem to be many videos of the final product! I've pulled all the ones I could of Facebook but alas - I guess you just had to be there! </p>

    <h2>Utilising the esquillo</h2>

    <p>
      DSA has a nice write up of <a href="https://dsa.tech/iot-devices/">using the esquilo here</a>, its an interesting board but we had some problems getting it working.
   </p>


   <div class="openingimage">
      <img src="party/dragon1.jpg" alt ="wintercroft dragon custume paper craft" width="85%" height="85%">
    </div>


    <p>
      I made my costume using a design from Wintercroft which inclused the mask and claws. This took about 4 hours to compolete but it was quite enjoyable - I enjoy paper craft and usually make a new piece of origarmi to use
      as a bookmark in each book I go through. Initially I wanted to simply use a spraypainted T-Shirt as the body but the effect was a little dissapointing, so instead I opted
      to cover the entire shirt in scales made from cardboard which were fastened with split pins (usually used used for binding papers together).
    </p>

    <p>
      This years costume was as a LED stickman. This was inspired by <a href="putlinkhere">this video</a> and was actually easy to construct in a single evening. I bought a black shirt
      from Uniqlo and the LED cable from Sim Lim Square and simple connected it in series to a battery pack of AAA batteries. The led was then crudely stitched to my shirt and jeans using
      black cotton which was impossible to see in the dark.
   </p>

   <p>
     Unfortunately this years costume was a little weak - I used a Batik cloth with a solo pattern I'd picked up Yogyakarta and a mask as an easy costume. I spent a little more time
     constructing the party lights.

     We made a shot block again but this time didn't add the LED lighting inside. This once again proved to be incredibly popular, even if it isn't incredibly efficient.
