    <h1 class="articletitle"> Growing Quantum Cluster States</h1>

<div class="articletext">
    <h2> A brief write up of my Masters project.  </h2>

    <p>As part of my Masters course, I completed a project with Joshua Waddington, and <a href="http://www.pieter-kok.staff.shef.ac.uk/">Dr Pieter Kok</a>
      (who also convieced me that LaTeX should be used whereever possible- I've hardly used Microsoft word since.) The final paper that result from the project is linked
        <a href="https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.88.012330">here</a>.

        <br><br>
        The work was completed some years ago - however, as a piece that resulted in a publication I thought it deserved a mention online. The work describes how it is possible to build clusters of qubits
      which may be used as a resource for measurment based quantum computing,
      and how many resources in terms of qubits would be needed to create a cluster of a set length, using different techniques and assuming different success probabilities.
      The work was completed almost entirely by writing vector based C++ code to produce monte carlo statistical results of cluster generation under different factors.
<br><br>

The work wasn't by any means groundbreaking - however, the project had clear goals and clear figures of merit to be determined, and was very successful. This was helped by the fact my partner fro the project,
 Joshua Waddington, had also been an intern at Sheffield in the summer (<a href="phase_transitions.html">as I had</a> )  It was published in Physics Review A
(with not need for refferee rebutals!) and has since recieved a few citations - not too bad for a masters project. The project was crucial for me achieving a place to studing in Singapore.

    <p>Abstract below:</p>

    <p>Cluster states for measurement-based quantum computing can be created with entangling operations of arbitrary low success probability.
      This will place a lower bound on the minimum lifetime of the qubits used in the implementation.
      Here, we present a simple scaling argument for the T2 time of the qubits for various cluster-state geometries, and we estimate the size of the qubit reservoir
      that is needed for the creation of miniclusters.</p>
