<div class="articletext">
    <h2> This is a write up of a project I did as part of a graduate class at SUTD, course 30.502 (Research Methods). </h2>

    <p>As part of my course requirements during my PhD, I took a course on data management and research methods taught by <a  href="https://epd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/robert-edward-simpson">Prof Robert Simpson</a>
    and got to preform some experiments on brainwaves using Search Results Electroencephalography (eeg) readers.
     In short - we used the machines to examine which brainwve frequencies were most prevalent during exposure to different types of music. <br><br>

   I Haven't included much of a writeup here as ive attatched the PDF document which I submitted as a report on the experiments. </p>

    <p>Abstract below:</p>

    <p>We present a project report for course 30.502 (Research Methods), focusing on the effect of
external auditory stimuli on various frequency components of brain waves using the Mindwave EEG
reader. We investigate to determine if there exists any statistically significant correlation between
the amplitudes associated with certain brainwave frequencies and different types of auditory inputs.
Our method uses the fast fourier transform to isolate relevant wavelength bands in order to compare
the powers between different stimuli. We find that although there seems to be some degree of the
above menioned correlation, it is not statistically significant. However, no conclusions can be drawn
as the number of test subjects were limited, and the equipment used to measure brain waves may
have had certain limitations which might have diminished the quality of our measurements. </p>
