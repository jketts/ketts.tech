    <h2>Running the worlds largest hitch-hiking group</h2>


    <p>Can you remember your introductory address at university - the speech the dean and the student president give to all of the new students?
      I can - which I believe is probably a rare thing. I only remember it in part - but it had a great affect on me - and the rest of my life.

      <br>
      And to think... I was almost to hungover to go...

        <br><br>
        The address was given by the current student union president - who I remember being refered to as 'Tall Tom' - reaching what looked like 6ft 5.
        He spoke a little about how univeisty is the time to try new things, embrace challenges, and say yes to new experiences (probably.. this is the part I've forgotten).
  <br>
        But then he gave an example about a time he joined a small hitch-hiking club to go to eastern Europe- and was forced to hide in the back of a van as they crossed the border Lithuanian border from Belarus.
  <br>
        My immediate thought was "that fun. In fact that sound more than just fun - that sounds like a story. "
  <br>
        After the talk I forgot all about the hitch-hiking club, until one day coming back from lectures through the quad, another student approached me asking if I was
        interested in Hitchhiking to Edinburgh - and if I did I would guaranteed to be able to join to go further across Europe in the spring.
  <br>
      And that was it! I remember the words about the importance of saying yes to new things and told took a leaflet she was offering. I got up early the next day, dragging a friend a long with me, so we could both get tickets to join the club (Yes tickets! There were limited places to join the hitch-hiking club -
         as dinners and parties were organised during the travels and through the year in Sheffield).
  <br>
    I hitch-hiked to Edinburgh with about 100 others - then got up and 6am - drunk as a skunk after our night out there, to go back to sheffield in time for an exam (which I completely flopped), and after that I was hooked.
  <br>
    I went on to travel around Europe with the group, and then joined the committee, growing the organisation to its largest size yet and raising over 100,000GBP for charity.
 <br><br>
   I used my new found hitching skills to travel coast to coast across the USA one summer during university, and then a year after leaving the society the world didn't seem that big anymore.
   So I moved to Singapore.

    <h2>So what is BUMMIT</h2>

<p>(From the wiki) Bummit is a student-run hitchhiking society at the University of Sheffield Students' Union,
  which raises funds for local charities by organizing several annual hitchhiking events, both within the UK and across Europe.
  It is the world's largest student organised hitchhiking group consisting of approximately 600 people per year, and is run by an elected committee under the umbrella o
  f the university's RAG society. The aim is to travel to the chosen destinations without spending any money on transport, solely relying on the kindness and hospitality of strangers.
  The trip's main destination is known in advance, but the halfway point is usually kept secret until the morning of departure. The wiki page can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bummit">here</a> and
  <a href="http://www.bummit.co.uk/"> the official website is here</a>. I won't explain exactly how it all works - you can read about that
   <a href="  http://www.bummit.co.uk/faqs.html">here</a>, along with common answers to how the whole things makes money for charity, and how we avoid anyone being murdered.
