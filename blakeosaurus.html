    <p> This is an old write up of a little afternoon project I completed a year or so ago. It was kind of interesting so I'm going to give a quite write up to remember how I did everything and keep the relevant files. <br>

      So I made 2 things. The first was a <em>Blakeosaurusrex</em>.

      <ul>

        <li>
          First download 123D catch onto your phone or PC. I only installed it on my computer. So first take a load of photos. I went around my friend Blake twice taking photos. Once at eye level and once from slightly about him - this allows the software to work out when the top of his head looks like.


        </li>

        <li>
          So I have my phone set up to upload all photos I take staight to dropbox and sync anytime wifi is connected. So by the time time Ive finished taking the photos they are already synced to my PC. Then you can easily use 123D catch software to generate the 3D model of the head.
        </li>

        <li>
          I then use meshmiker to cut the two models together and save the final file as an .stl for the 3D printers. Always use a mouse when trying to use meshmixer - I always forget this is the case when using the program for the first time in a while and find my model impossible to control on a trackpad.
        </li>

        <li>
          The second thing to make was something to use as a test for the kiln im building. For this I found two files on... The first is was a deer skull and the second is a bust of a mariener with a sweet beard. Using meshmixer again I simply clipped the horns o the rams skull and attatched them to the bust. This was then printed on one of the 3D printers.
        </li>

        <li>
          The next step... Take a latex mould of of the 3D print so we can work towards metal casting!
        </li>
      </ul>


      <div class="openingimage">

      <div class="openingimage">

      </div>

    </p>


    <p>So I've been building a kiln at home/at the Uno. Why? Well I've been making a few items on some of the 3D printers in the uni, and it would be really nice if i could make them out of something other that week plastic. There is a titanium printer and a milling machine.. but I thought that the easiest way to take an item from idea to physical form maybe to do the following:

    <ol>

    <li>
    Make a 3D diesign in ...
    </li>

    <li>
      3D print the design
    </li>

    <div class="openingimage">
      <img src="images/bustmod.png" alt ="homomorphic" width="50%" height="50%">
    </div>



    <li>
    Make a latex cast of the design from the 3D print.
    </li>

    <li>
    Using this cast we then then make several wave models
    </li>

    <li>
      Using the wax model we then make plaster casts
    </li>


    <li>
    Then melt out the wax and fill the cast with molten metal
    </li>

    <li>
    Smash the plaster cast
    </li>

    </ol>
    </p>
